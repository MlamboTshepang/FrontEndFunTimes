<h1>Inspiration</h1>
<p>
    Inspiration has built many people. It has destroyed more.
    
    I treat inspiration like a flame during a windstorm. It's very easy to snuff it out. You have to nurture inspiration and use it correctly. I get inspired by general conversations and talking to people. Finding out their struggles and how they encounter them. This helps me to further contextualise my struggles and the way in which I am dealing with them.

    Thereâ€™s a young lady I encountered recently who reminded me that it is possible to do it all. Bringing me back to a natural state of wonder for how multiple people use their energy to further themselves, grow into the people they want to become and win. To gather my inspiration from others in vastly different fields and walks of life is a simple and effective method I use for building into the person I want to become. For inspiration, I believe, should be used in bringing up ones energy levels.

    The energy boost provided by inspiration has the ability to extract the last .5% in the tank and use it to make a difference. Be sure that when you are inspired you use it to get you off your backside and get something done. For The wind is quick to grow a flame and similarly quick to blow one out.

    Inspiration brings a spark of life into the next task. This is used as a boost of energy to get through the task ahead. I find this is the easiest way to get a new task rolling.  Inspiration provides motivation to do something which was previously scary but now seems manageable. I think that this is what makes or breaks you. The motivation levels are what gives one the ability to do the hard task even when there is no ziel to do the task. Invite inspiration into your space and use it to fuel your motivation.

    Motivation is the physical act of completing the task. It is important to stay motivated but motivation does not work if there is no consistency. Be able to understand that constant is key. Consistency. Being consistent in your path is why will showcase the growth and thus provide inspiration from you for you to complete what you want to do.
